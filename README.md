# Web API's Quiz homework

Goal: A timed quiz with programming questions that is scored. Scores are saved so that you can gauge your progress on the matireal.

# Functionality

When the page is loaded there is a start button and a timer counter. When you click on the start button, the timer starts to count down. For every wrong answer 3 points are deducted from your score.

# Game Over

When the timer ends OR the user has answered all the questions the user can save their initials and score

# Issues

I have all the code in place but when I click on the start button it disappears (like it should) but the questions don't appear.

This project has 2 JavaScript files (both are linked in the html)so that I could separate the questions array from the functional part of the JavaScript. Another classmate suggested doing this.
